Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
    JJ: I like it because it helps keep sthings seperate but working together and it's easier to think about and organize. The modualrity is of encapsulation is like having different modules in python.  

    Nazifa: Encapsulation helped me understand how to code in java better, because it allowed me recognize what is happening with the methods. It also helped me betture understand what is associated with what, and what each method is truly doing. It taught me a lot about how to incorporate the classes methods in other classes. 



- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

    JJ: What work was utilizing the slides from class the example of how to do it in the beginning. The struggle part for me was getting started and making sure that the syntax was correct because I kept getting a lot of errors. Definetly go to office hours and give yourself time to complete assignments because it does actually take a while to complete over the course of a few days.  

    Nazifa: What worked was creating the attributes, constructor, and setting up the methods. What didn't work was some of the encapsulaiton and using other classes methods inside an accessor sometimes due to the syntax being wrong or the logic being wrong. Advice I would give is to definitely go to TA hours and office hours and also to work in groups to do the homeworks because it its a lot easier to figure out errors and what to do next when you aren't alone.
