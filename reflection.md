- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
    I like it because it helps keep sthings seperate but working together and it's easier to think about and organize. The modualrity is of encapsulation is like having different modules in python. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

    What work was utilizing the slides from class the example of how to do it in the beginning. The struggle part for me was getting started and making sure that the syntax was correct because I kept getting a lot of errors. 

    Definetly go to office hours and give yourself time to complete assignments because it does actually take a while to complete over the course of a few days.
